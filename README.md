# ðŸ“°ðŸ“· Image-Recommendation-for-Wikipedia-Articles

This project develops a multimodal matching system that recommends relevant images for Wikipedia articles using advanced deep learning techniques. By enhancing the visual context of Wikipedia, we aim to improve reader engagement and accessibility, particularly for visual learners and second-language readers.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
Our dataset includes:
- **5,000+** featured Wikipedia articles
- **30,000+** associated images with metadata (title, URL, and description)

We focused on high-quality, curated articles with minimal missing data. Edge cases such as articles with excessive image fragments (e.g., *Victoria Cross*) were identified and handled.
